projects:
- name: Representing words & concepts
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCe members, Drs. Piazza & xxx
  url: "posts/research/representing/"
  summary: What are the neuro-cognitive correlates of semantic knowledge? We use neuroimaging to study the distributed yet specialized cortical networks involved.
  tags: ["fMRI","MEG"]

- name: Loosing words & concepts
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role:  NoCe members, Drs. Gorno-Tempini & Lukic
  url: "posts/research/loosing/"
  summary: We also study which brain lesions can lead to degraded neural semantic representations, their effects on behavior, and how their loss can be partially compensated.

- name: Learning words & concepts
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCe members, Drs. Piazza, Vigano & Bilgin
  url: "posts/research/learning/"
  summary: We are also interested in how cogntive and neural representations of concepts (and words) are built in the first place.
  tags: ["fMRI", "EEG"]

- name: Concepts across languages and cultures
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCe members
  url: "posts/research/multi/"
  summary: We are interested in cross-linguistic and cross-culturale differences.
  tags: ["fMRI", "Neuropsychology"]

- name: Concepts & words across people
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCe members, Drs. Gorno-Tempini & Chagas
  url: "posts/research/langnetwork/"
  summary: We are interested in individual differences in language processing.

- name: Mathematical Cognition
  logo: images/author/1299786.svg
  role: NoCE members, Drs. Gorno-Tempini & Chagas
  url: "posts/research/math/"
  summary: Both in normal and pathological conditions, we study a special set of concepts - math ones.
